# Team-Profile-Generator

## Description
This repository is for a Node.js command-line application that takes in information about employees on a software engineering team, and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person.

## How To Use
1. Clone this repository locally to your computer.

2. If your computer does not have node.js already installed, go to [Nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and download the node.js v16.18.0 installer for your platform, and follow the installer steps.

3. The next step is to download [Inquirer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer). To do this, in the in the command line run:  `npm i` .

4. Once inquirer is installed, in the command line run:  `node index.js` .

5. The prompts for employee information will show, and you will need to enter an answer for each question.

6. After all the prompts are answered with your inputs, enter "No".

## Mock-up
The following screenshot shows the intended appearance of the application:

## Challenges
I ran out of time to complete the assignment. I was unable to complete the process of exporting the employee data to an HTML page. I became stuck at the point of ending the inquirer quetions of adding new emplpoyees. In the future I will come back to this repository to make it fully functional. I learned a wide amount of information while working on this assignment, and though it was challenging, I grew a deeper level of comfort working with Javascript, Node, and Inquirer.
